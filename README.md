This project implements different sorting algorithms built using Java 11,
it was build using TDD, continuous integration and other techniques to ensure it's quality.

# Bubble sort algorithm
Average case complexity: n^2
Best case complexity: n when array is sorted.
Worst case complexity: n^2 when array is reverse sorted.

# Merge sort
Average case complexity: nlogn
Best case complexity: nlogn
Worst case complexity: nlogn

# Quick sort
Average case complexity: nlogn
Best case complexity: nlogn
Worst case complexity: n^2 when the array is sorted or reverse sorted.
